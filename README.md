# Full Stack Toolkit: "Empire of Thoughts" Portfolio Project
## Welcome!

<p id="welcome"></p>

## This is my Portfolio 4 Project regarding the Code Institute's Diploma in Software Development (E-commerce Applications).
It is a social media platform based on the blog principles - built with Django / Python /Bootstrap and deployed on Heroku.

## **Agile**
### **Planning Phase**
The current trends on social media are often referring to a mental health awareness.

At first I collected the data about online activity and tags connected with mental health awareness.
I have also collected the data in accordance with global statistics about mental illnesses. Following the WHO (add link) the amount of people who suffer for particular illness is listed below:
* Depression 264 mln
* Bipolar 45 mln
* Schizophrenia 20 mln
* Autism 75 mln
* ADHD 366 mln
* PTSD 8 mln in a given year
* Personality disorders 608.4 mln

Second step was to talk directly to the customers in order to understand their needs and desires in online blogging. I've chosen two people who are very active in social media networks and treat the topic of mental health. After a brainstorming session with clients (about 30 minutes) I had a brief information about the Persona, who I decided to test more via survey.

The results have shown that exactly half of responders struggle with depression or other mental health issues:

#### Activity in social media:
* All of the responders are checking social media everyday and the majority of them spend more than 2h daily.
* Over half of responders like to read posts and comments.
* 30% of responders belong to the support groups on Facebook.
* 40% responders admit that they write long messages to their friends on the social communicators and that writing helps them express themselves.
* Only 20% of responders do not post anything on social media.

#### Extra features:
1. Very important:
Comment section, discussion panel - 80% responders admit that support from others is very important for them
2. Important:
Daily affirmations - 60% responders admit that motivation quotes and affirmation are quite important
3. Useful:
Q&A block - All of them consider the possibility to ask questions online as an important feature

Following my course with Code Institute, I also took one of the challenges from the learning material and created a short video presenting the planning process.
Please, see the video published on my YouTube channel: (link)


### **Product roadmap**
After analyzing the results of the survey and comparing them with a principles stated during the brainstorm session, I was able to create an image of Persona and the basic road map with the requirements to achieve minimum viable product:

At this point I started to develop a product backlog in Jira, where I stated: 9 epics containing User Stories. Each User Story had assigned story points, tasks and a priority label based on the MoSCoW prioritisation technique.
Please, see the images of Jira.


### **Release planning**
According to the Agile principles, I created two work sprints (cycles). I created my Sprints for the time of 2 weeks, where each week contains 30h of work, which is equal to the workforce of one part-time working developer (in this case I have assigned all the tasks to myself). Based on the story points I was able to estimate the time of each User Story and assign them into Sprints. The Story Points are equal to:

Story Points | Importance | Time
---|---|---
1p | small task | up to 2h of work
3p | middle task | up to 4h of work
5p | big task | more than 4h of work

The big task should not take more than 8h of work.


### **Sprint planning**
In the first part of work (Sprint 1) the team should deliver Minimum Variable Product, which means create a basic diary page, which contains registration/login features and allows the User to publish a note as well as read journals of others users and comment on them. The second Sprint contains adding more features like: categories (tags), affirmations and goals section. Before the second Sprint begins, the realization should be discussed with the Client and necessary changes should be added to the workflow.


### **Daily stand-ups**
This point of agile development would be necessary if there was more than one developer working on the project. The short daily stand-up meeting helps the team accomplish their tasks by brief update on the work done and work which is planned for that day. I have been reviewing the workflow on the beginning of each day of development to keep track of the achieved tasks in comparison to the estimated time so that I could later implement the changes into a Second Sprint.

### **Sprint review and retrospective**
After the end of the First Sprint I had scheduled a meeting with my mentor to discuss the current development and seek further review or advice.Secondly I have also presented the deployed page to the clients and had another brainstorm session to discuss further development.With all the changes included in the backlog, I was then ready to begin working on the Second Sprint:Pic - second Sprint planned in the beggingPic - second Sprint planned in the end


# Scope
Empire of Thoughts (ET) is a social networking website which allows users, who register for free profiles, to write a personal journal as well as read and comment journals of others.
The mission of ET is to provide a safe environment for people who struggle with mental health issues or those who have concern for mental health, where users can share their stories and thoughts with related communities.
Categorization of journals via adding a tag included in the tags recognition, will allow users to find people who match their problems.
During registration, users can choose their own nick, which will allow them to keep the actual identity anonymous. The comment section is designed for support and conversation. The rules are specified in accordance to the help/support groups created on social media, where certain behaviors- common for the social media platforms (like hate speech or themes about the suicide) are filtered and blocked in some cases by a web Administrator. The Admin can delete posts/comments added by a user as well as block the user's account if his actions online are against the rules.
